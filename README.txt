This is a collection of scripts for netcfg to call pppd for a mobile broadband
connection using a USB dongle.

You may need to add some scripts to /etc/ppp/chatscripts/ to connect, see the
files in that directory and
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/3G_and_GPRS_modems_with_pppd for more
details.

Remember to relink the symbolic links to point to the correct scripts.
